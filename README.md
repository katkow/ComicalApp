## General info


ComicalApp is a university project for Android. This app allows users to access best comics by polish writers found on the web. Each comic is divided into seasons/chapters, and the user can easily navigate the pages by swiping - just like a regular e-book. Cloud database containing the images has been set up on Google Firebase for easy and quick access to the pages. In addition, various libraries were used for a smoother experience for the reader.
